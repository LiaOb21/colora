How to run `colora`:
```
conda config --set channel_priority flexible # if you want to use conda/mamba otherwise genomescope won't work

snakemake --software-deployment-method conda --conda-frontend mamba --snakefile workflow/Snakefile --cores all

snakemake --cluster "sbatch --cpus-per-task 50 --mem 200G -t 3-00" --use-conda --conda-frontend mamba --snakefile workflow/Snakefile
```

Before executing the command, ensure you have appropriately changed your `config.yaml`

* The workflow will occur in the snakemake-workflow-catalog once it has been made public. Then the link under "Usage" will point to the usage instructions if `<owner>` and `<repo>` were correctly set.
